# 2dAdventure

Welcome to 2dAdventure, 2d game made in C#. Work "still" in progress.

This is just an example of "one" of the game's levels.
All the animations are made by me. In this picture we see our hero shooting with bullets...shaorma-bullets.

Here's the animation for jumping. All the animations are both verified and inserted by the character's direction. This, for example, is the jumpleft animation; one of the many...

This is the leftcrouch's animation.

This is the animation for "rightwalking".

These are some tips to look-up to for the collision and resolution.

There are more animations. Only the "faintedanimation" is left to be added. The resolution is set for my laptop device (1366x768), but I made a method which puts everything in order for every other resolution (if_resolution_differs();). I set the limits of the borders, of the player and everything. All the collisions are done, with everything. There's a collision for the blocks(those in kaki) and a collision for the platform(the one in red), which is moving up and down, allowing the hero to get on top of the other blocks. I have to shape a litlle the code to be cleaner and for the items, the inventories in which the items are held, the enemies(with the animations...hooray...) ....and the second player, if I forgot to mention that. 
In this realm, 2dAdventure has 2 players, in CO-OP mode.
More updates soon.

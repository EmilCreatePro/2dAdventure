# 2dAdventure

Welcome to 2dAdventure, 2d game made in C#. Work "still" in progress.

This is just an example of "one" of the game's levels.
All the animations are made by me. In this picture we see our hero shooting with bullets...shaorma-bullets.

Here's the animation for jumping. All the animations are both verified and inserted by the character's direction. This, for example, is the jumpleft animation; one of the many...

This is the leftcrouch's animation.

This is the animation for "rightwalking".

These are some tips to look-up to for the collision and resolution.


There are more animations. Only the "faintedanimation" is left to be added. I also have to make the background, which I'll do once the game is finished.
I'm going to also add some background music, special effects and some funny special effects...thake it like some kind of "easter-egs".
The resolution is set for my laptop display (1366x768), but I made a method which puts everything in order for every other resolution (if_resolution_differs();). I set the limits of the borders, of the player and everything (you can play with up to 10 displays at a maximum resolution of X=10.000; totally unnecesarry). 
All the collisions are done, with everything. There's a collision for the blocks(those in kaki) and a collision for the platform(the one in red), which is moving up and down, allowing the hero to get on top of the other blocks. 
I have to shape the code a litlle bit to be cleaner and for the items, the inventories in which the items are going to be held, the enemies(with the animations...hooray...) ....and the second player, if I forgot to mention that. 
In this 2d-world, 2dAdventure has 2 players, in CO-OP mode.
More updates soon.
